    Glowing-Octo-Guacamole doesn't mean anything, it's a temporary code name for our project.
  </summary>  
    We were searching a name at the beginning of the project, but weren't able to find one that sounded good. 
    So we used the wonderful "random name" option of Github, and now we are Guacamolers!
